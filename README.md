### BEFORE YOU INTERACT…


【**001.**】`Please refrain from actively engaging with us via roleplaying or acting as a character from a shared source.` Just because we may be in a skin of a source that you know of does not mean we will roleplay with you; typically the skin we are using is likely who is fronting. **Do not take it that just because we are a system/introjects/IRLs that we will act just like the source we are from; we are each our own individual.**

【**002.**】`If you are a minor/under 18, refrain from making statements or using compliments such as “hot” or “attractive” when referring to us.` **We are bodily 18+ and this makes us uncomfortable.**

【**003.**】`Do not cuddle/hide behind us if you are a stranger.` We do not have C+H in our names and we do not feel comfortable when randos cuddle with us. **If you need to be hidden, please ask to hide behind us first.**

【**004.**】`Do not sit too close to us if you are a stranger.` We will move away if we do not feel comfortable, please take this as a sign to keep your distance.

【**005.**】`Please do not come up and vent/rant to us.` We do not want people, specifically strangers, coming up and then asking to vent/rant on us. **If you need any advice we may or may not be able to give you some, but please refrain from throwing in vents and rants into the mix.**

【**006.**】`Do not come up to us with discourse of any type.` We do not wish to engage in any discourse, whether it be related to a content creator, a specific PonyTown name-tag, etc., especially if it involves harassing/putting down individuals who like a specific content creator or use a specific name-tag that is considered "controversial".

### DO NOT INTERACT IF…


【**001.**】`You fall under the Basic DNI Criteria:` **homophobic, transphobic, pro-endo systems, etc...**

【**002.**】`You are under 18 years of age (and/or lie about your age or being 18+).` We do not wish to interact with those under 18. **If you lie about being 18+ or older than you really are then you don't deserve our trust.**

【**003.**】`You are an ERPer and/or go up to random people asking to ERP with you.` We do not ERP and we find it absolutely horrendous, especially if you are doing it in a public setting; ***NO ONE* signed up to witness you do that shit, and most of us just want to relax or hang out with others, NOT watch you ERP. Take that shit to Party Island or into whispers.**

【**004.**】`You **actively** copy other people’s art and/or PonyTown skins or use YouTube tutorial/copypasta skins.` Using tut skins to develop your own style is fine, just not when you use it because *"Ooh pretty skin! It'll make me look like I know how to make skins!"*

【**005.**】`You are in a skin/are in the community(s) of…` **Dream/DreamTeam/DSMP, Welcome Home, FNF, Undertale, Yandere Simulator, *any character/game by Gatobob (such as BTD and TPOF), any character/game by Scopophobia Studios (such as John Doe).*** Simple enough, we do not wish to interact with people in these communities/skins.

【**006.**】`You engage in discourse of any type...` **content-creator, PonyTown name-tags, etc...** `and/or go out to harass/put down any individual over liking said content-creator(s) or for using a name-tag that's labelled as "controversial".`

#### **NOTE: WHAT IS LISTED IN OUR DNI LIST ARE *NOT* TRIGGERS; THEY MAKE US UNCOMFORTABLE, HOWEVER WE ARE NOT TRIGGERED BY ANYTHING ON THE LIST.**

【**001.**】Please be aware that `we are a system and we each have our own boundaries` **(most of us collectively sharing similar boundaries)**.

【**002.**】`Please be respectful of our host’s IRLs.` if you have **nothing** good to say about IRLs or are going to harass our host for having IRLs then **do not interact.**

【**003.**】`Our host does not consider their IRLs as delusional`, here is a [**SOURCE**](https://rentry.co/IRLnotdelusional) as to what IRLs are and why they may not be delusional.
