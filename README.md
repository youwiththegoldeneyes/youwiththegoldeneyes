### BEFORE YOU INTERACT…

###### ⚠️ Please note that `we are not comfortable with those who attempt to roleplay with us, minors who call us “hot or attractive”, strangers cuddling with us, and strangers sitting too close to us.` ⚠️

【**001.**】Please ==refrain from actively engaging with us via roleplaying or acting as a character from a shared source==. Just because we may be in a skin of a source that you know of does not mean we will roleplay with you; typically the skin we are using is likely who is fronting. **Do not take it that just because we are a system/introjects/IRLs that we will act just like the source we are from.**

【**002.**】`If you are a minor`, refrain from making statements or using compliments such as “hot” or “attractive” when referring to us **(we are legally 18+ and this makes us uncomfortable)**.

【**003.**】Do not cuddle/hide behind us if you are a stranger. We do not have C+H in our names and we do not feel comfortable when randos cuddle with us; `if you need to be hidden, please ask to hide behind us first.` 

【**004.**】==Do not sit too close to us if you are a stranger==; we will move away if we do not feel comfortable, please take this as a sign to keep your distance.

【**005.**】==Please do not come up and vent/rant to us.== We do not want people, specifically strangers, coming up and then asking to vent/rant on us; `if you need any advice we may or may not be able to give you some`, but please refrain from throwing in vents and rants into the mix.
