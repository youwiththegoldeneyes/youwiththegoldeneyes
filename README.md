### BEFORE YOU INTERACT…


【**001.**】`Please refrain from actively engaging with us via roleplaying or acting as a character from a shared source.` Just because we may be in a skin of a source that you know of does not mean we will roleplay with you; typically the skin we are using is likely who is fronting. **Do not take it that just because we are a system/introjects/IRLs that we will act just like the source we are from; we are each our own individual.**

【**002.**】`If you are a minor/under 18, refrain from making statements or using compliments such as “hot” or “attractive” when referring to us.` **We are bodily 18+ and this makes us uncomfortable.**

【**003.**】`Do not cuddle/hide behind us if you are a stranger.` We do not have C+H in our names and we do not feel comfortable when randos cuddle with us. **If you need to be hidden, please ask to hide behind us first.**

【**004.**】`Do not sit too close to us if you are a stranger.` We will move away if we do not feel comfortable, please take this as a sign to keep your distance. If we are comfortable with you we may sit near you.

【**005.**】`Please do not come up and vent/rant to us.` We do not want people, specifically strangers, coming up and then asking to vent/rant on us. **If you need any advice we may or may not be able to give you some, but please refrain from throwing in vents and rants into the mix.**

【**006.**】`Do not come up to us with discourse of any type.` We do not wish to engage in any discourse, whether it be related to a content creator, a specific PonyTown name-tag, etc., especially if it involves harassing/putting down individuals who like a specific content creator or use a specific name-tag that is considered "controversial".

### DO NOT INTERACT IF…


【**001.**】`You fall under the Basic DNI Criteria:` **homophobic, transphobic, pro-endo systems, etc...**

【**002.**】`You are under 17 years of age (and/or lie about your age or being 18+).` We do not wish to interact with those under 17. **If you lie about being 18+ or older than you really are then you don't deserve our trust.**

【**003.**】`You are an ERPer and/or go up to random people asking to ERP with you.` We do not ERP and we find it disgusting, especially if you are doing it in a public setting. **Take your ERP to party island or whispers.**

【**004.**】`You **actively** copy other people’s art and/or PonyTown skins or use YouTube tutorial/copypasta skins.` Using tut skins to develop your own style is alright with us as long as you state you're using them to help improve your style/skin-making.

【**005.**】`You are in a skin/are in the community(s) of…` ***Dream/DreamTeam/DSMP, Wilbur Soot*, Welcome Home, FNF, Undertale, *Yandere Simulator, any character/game by Gatobob (such as BTD and TPOF), any character/game by Scopophobia Studios (such as John Doe).*** Simple enough, we do not wish to interact with people in these communities/skins; `exceptions are Introjects/Fictives/Factives.`

【**006.**】`You engage in discourse of any type...` **content-creator, PonyTown name-tags, etc...** `and/or go out to harass/put down any individual over liking said content-creator(s) or for using a name-tag that's labelled as "controversial".` Unless they like/support a content creator that is a bad person/criminal... in which case please make them aware that their content-creator is a bad person.

#### **NOTE: WHAT IS LISTED IN OUR DNI LIST ARE *NOT* TRIGGERS; THEY MAKE US UNCOMFORTABLE, HOWEVER WE ARE NOT TRIGGERED BY ANYTHING ON THE LIST.**

### EXTRA…


【**001.**】Please be aware that `we are a system and we each have our own boundaries` **(most of us collectively sharing similar boundaries)**.

【**002.**】`Please be respectful of our host’s IRLs.` if you have **nothing** good to say about IRLs or are going to harass our host for having IRLs then **do not interact.**

【**003.**】`Our host does not consider their IRLs as delusional`, here is a [**SOURCE**](https://rentry.co/IRLnotdelusional) as to what IRLs are and why they may not be delusional.

【**004.**】Given the recent light of Wilbur Soot's actions and what he has done to people, we would like to make it clear that `NONE OF US, nor our Wilbur introject, condones CC!Wilbur's actions`; our Wilbur has stated that ***he wishes to separate ties with his source as best as he can*** and that users are aware that he **DOES NOT** support his source, ***nor is he anything like his source***. Again, `we DO NOT condone Wilbur Soot's actions and we DO NOT support him or his music.` Alice and Shelby deserve all the support they can get, as well as other victims who have been abused.


#### ***If you are unsure of who is fronting or what the host's IRL currently is please check our GitHub status or ask.***
